## AutoIt WebView2 Component (COM Interop)

A powerful bridge that allows **AutoIt** to use the modern **Microsoft Edge WebView2** (Chromium) engine via a C# COM wrapper. This project enables you to render modern HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript directly inside your AutoIt applications with a 100% event-driven architecture.

---
### 🚀 Key Features

* **Chromium Engine**: Leverage the speed and security of modern Microsoft Edge.
* **Bi-directional Communication**: Send messages from JS to AutoIt (`postMessage`) and execute JS from AutoIt (`ExecuteScript`).
* **Event-Driven**: No more `While/Sleep` loops to check for updates. Uses COM Sinks for instant notifications.
* **Advanced JSON Handling**: Includes a built-in `JsonParser` for deep-path data access (e.g., `user.items\[0].name`).
* **Content Control**: Built-in Ad-blocker, CSS injection, and Zoom control.
* **Dual Architecture**: Fully supports both **x86** and **x64** environments.
- **Extension Support**: Load and use Chromium extensions (unpacked).
- **Advanced Cookie & CDP Control**: Full cookie manipulation and raw access to Chrome DevTools Protocol.
- **Kiosk & Security Mode**: Enhanced methods to restrict user interaction for production environments.

### 🛠 Prerequisites

1. **.NET Framework 4.8** or higher.
2. **Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime**.

   * *The registration script will check for this and provide a download link if missing.*

---
### 📦 Deployment \& Installation

1. **Extract** NetWebView2Lib folder to a permanent location.
2. **Run**:
    `\NetWebView2Lib\bin\Register_web2.au3` to Register
   * Verifies the WebView2 Runtime presence.
   * Registers `NetWebView2Lib.dll` for COM Interop on both 32-bit and 64-bit.
     
    or `\NetWebView2Lib\bin\Unregister.au3` to Unregister

1. **Run `\Example\*`** to see the bridge in action.

## NetWebView2Lib v1.4.0 - Major Update

This version introduces significant architectural improvements, focusing on deep integration with WebView2 settings and a more robust event-driven system.

### 🚀 Key Highlights

* **Comprehensive Settings Control**: Direct access to browser behaviors via new properties. Toggle DevTools, Context Menus, Script Dialogs, and Browser Accelerators (`AreDevToolsEnabled`, `AreDefaultContextMenusEnabled`, etc.) directly from your AutoIt script.
* 🎯 **Permanent JS Injection**: Introducing `AddInitializationScript`. Injected JavaScript (like bridges or libraries) now persists across page navigations and refreshes automatically, managed via a new Script ID tracking system.
* **Custom Context Menus**: Intercept right-clicks with the new `OnContextMenu` event. Receive rich JSON metadata including coordinates, element tags, selected text, and source URLs to build native-looking custom menus.
* **Focus & Lifecycle Management**: Navigation is now fully observable through `OnNavigationStarting` and `OnNavigationCompleted`.
* **Integrated Utilities**: Added native methods for `Encode/DecodeURI` and `Base64` (UTF-8) to handle data transfers between AutoIt and JavaScript seamlessly.
* **Enhanced State Sync**: Real-time events for Title, URL, and Zoom changes to keep your AutoIt GUI perfectly in sync with the browser state.

### 🛠️ Migration Note (Important)

Due to changes in the COM Dispatch IDs (DispIds) for better organization, it is **highly recommended** to run the included `RegCleaner.au3` before registering the new version. This ensures that any stale registry entries from previous builds are purged, preventing "Object action failed" errors.

### 📖 Understanding the WebDemo (v1.4)

The **`WebDemo_v1.4.au3`** is not just a browser, 
 it is a showcase of **Bi-directional Intelligence**. 
 It demonstrates how AutoIt can "read" the DOM state via COM events to provide a context-specific user interface.

#### 1. Context-Aware Menu (The "Right-Click" Magic)

The demo intercepts the native context menu and replaces it with a dynamic AutoIt menu. The options change based on the **HTML element** under your cursor:

- **📥 Table Intelligence**:
    
    - **Action**: Right-click anywhere inside a `<table>`.
        
    - **What happens**: The library detects the `tagName`, calculates the table's index via coordinates, and offers an **Export to CSV** option. It uses the `bridge.js` to scrape the data directly from the browser's memory.
        
- **📋 Form Automation**:
    
    - **Action**: Right-click on an `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `<form>`.
        
    - **What happens**:
        
        - **Map Form to JSON**: Automatically crawls the form and generates a JSON file with all current values.
            
        - **Fill Form from JSON**: Lets you select a previously saved JSON file to instantly re-populate the form.
            
- **🔍 Smart Selection**:
    
    - **Action**: Highlight any text on the page and right-click.
        
    - **What happens**: The menu offers a Google Search for that specific string, using the new native `EncodeURI` method to handle special characters.
        

#### 2. Advanced Utilities

- **📸 Full Page Screenshot**: Unlike standard screen captures, this utility renders the **entire document** (including the parts you need to scroll to see) and saves it as a high-quality PNG.
    
- **⚡ Persistent Bridge**: Notice that even if you navigate to a new website or refresh, the "Table Export" and "Form Mapping" still work. This is thanks to the new `AddInitializationScript` which ensures our `bridge.js` is part of every page's DNA.

#### ⚙️ How it Works: The "Context-JSON" Bridge

The secret behind this intelligent menu is the seamless communication between the Browser's DOM and AutoIt's COM interface.

#### The Workflow:

1. **The Trigger**: When you right-click, the `bridge.js` (injected via `AddInitializationScript`) intercepts the event.
    
2. **Data Gathering**: It instantly gathers metadata about the element under the mouse (Coordinates, Tag Type, Selected Text, Image Sources, etc.).
    
3. **The Dispatch**: This metadata is packed into a **JSON string** and sent to AutoIt via the `OnContextMenu` event.
    
4. **The Decision**: AutoIt receives the JSON, parses it using `NetJson.Parser`, and decides which menu items to show.
    

#### Why JSON?

- **Structure**: It allows passing multiple data points (X, Y, Tag, URL) in a single, organized string.
    
- **Performance**: By prefixing with `JSON:`, we bypass complex string encoding, making the communication near-instant.
    
- **Flexibility**: You can easily add more data points to the `bridge.js` without ever changing the core DLL.

#### 💡 Pro Tip for Developers:

> "You can extend this! If you want to detect specifically if a user clicked on a **Video** or a **PDF link**, just update the `bridge.js` to include those tags.
