## 🪪 AutoIt WebView2 Component (COM Interop)

A powerful bridge that allows **AutoIt** to use the modern **Microsoft Edge WebView2** (Chromium) engine via a C# COM wrapper. This project enables you to render modern HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript directly inside your AutoIt applications with a 100% event-driven architecture.

---
### 🚀 Key Features

* **Chromium Engine**: Leverage the speed and security of modern Microsoft Edge.
* **Bi-directional Communication**: Send messages from JS to AutoIt (`postMessage`) and execute JS from AutoIt (`ExecuteScript`).
* **Event-Driven**: No more `While/Sleep` loops to check for updates. Uses COM Sinks for instant notifications.
* **Advanced JSON Handling**: Includes a built-in `JsonParser` for deep-path data access (e.g., `user.items\[0].name`).
* **Content Control**: Built-in Ad-blocker, CSS injection, and Zoom control.
* **Dual Architecture**: Fully supports both **x86** and **x64** environments.
- **Extension Support**: Load and use Chromium extensions (unpacked).
- **Advanced Cookie & CDP Control**: Full cookie manipulation and raw access to Chrome DevTools Protocol.
- **Kiosk & Security Mode**: Enhanced methods to restrict user interaction for production environments.

---

### 🛠 Prerequisites

1. **.NET Framework 4.8** or higher.
2. **Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime**.

   * *The registration script will check for this and provide a download link if missing.*

---
### 📦 Deployment & Installation

1. **Extract** the `NetWebView2Lib` folder to a permanent location.
    
2. **Clean & Prepare (Essential Step):**
    
    - If you have a previous version installed, it is **highly recommended** to run the included `\bin\RegCleaner.au3` before registering the new version.
        
    - This ensures that any stale registry entries from previous builds are purged, preventing "Object action failed" errors and GUID conflicts.
        
3. **Registration:**
    
    - Run `\bin\Register_web2.au3` to register the library.
        
    - This script verifies the **WebView2 Runtime** presence and registers `NetWebView2Lib.dll` for COM Interop on both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
        
4. **Uninstallation:**
    
    - To remove the library from your system, simply run `\bin\Unregister.au3`.
        
5. **Run Examples:**
    
    - Execute any script in the `\Example\*` folder to see the bridge in action.

## 🚀 What's New in v1.4.2 - Major Update

This major update transforms **NetWebView2Lib** into a high-performance automation framework, bridging the gap between synchronous procedural logic (AutoIt) and asynchronous web environments.

### ⚡ Key Features & Enhancements

#### **1. Synchronous Script Execution**

The long-awaited `ExecuteScriptWithResult(script)` is here. You can now execute JavaScript and receive the return value directly in a single line of AutoIt code, eliminating the need for complex event-callback chains.

- **Automatic Unescaping:** Results are automatically cleaned from JSON quotes and escaped characters.
    
- **Safety First:** Built-in 5-second timeout to prevent application hangs during script execution.
    

#### **2. Persistent Code Injection**

The new `AddInitializationScript(script)` allows you to register JavaScript or CSS that "survives" page reloads and navigations.

- **Persistence:** Scripts are automatically re-injected by the engine the moment a new document is created.
    
- **Stackable:** Multiple scripts can be registered simultaneously without overwriting previous ones.
    

#### **3. Unified Context Menu Handling**

A new, streamlined event `OnContextMenuRequested` provides direct access to context data without manual JSON parsing.

- **Direct Access:** Instantly get the `LinkURL`, `X/Y Coordinates`, and `SelectedText`.
    
- **Legacy Support:** Remains 100% compatible with the previous JSON-based context event for existing projects.
    

#### **4. Integrated Data Sync & Base64 Support**

- **Direct Data Binding:** The new `SyncInternalData(json, variable)` provides an atomic way to synchronize complex data from AutoIt to the browser window without manual JS execution.
    
- **Native Base64 Support:** The `NetJson.Parser` now includes built-in Base64 encoding and decoding (including `DecodeB64ToFile`), providing a high-speed path for processing screenshots and binary data.

#### **5. Professional Layout & Diagnostics**

- **Smart Resizing (v1.4.2):** Replaced legacy docking with native OS message interception for pixel-perfect resizing.
    
- **Global Error Handling:** The standard showcase now implements a global COM error handler for professional debugging.

### 📝 Quick Migration Example (AutoIt)

**Before (v1.4.1):**

AutoIt

```
$oWeb.ExecuteScript("document.title")
; ... Wait for WebMessageReceived event ...
; ... Parse JSON ...
```

**Now (v1.4.2):**

AutoIt

```
Local $sTitle = $oWeb.ExecuteScriptWithResult("document.title")
ConsoleWrite("Page Title: " & $sTitle & @CRLF)
```

---

### 📦 Technical Breakdown

|**Method / Property**|**DispId**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`AddInitializationScript`|184|Persistent JS injection across navigations.|
|`ExecuteScriptWithResult`|188|Synchronous JS execution (Returns String).|
|`SetAutoResize`|189|Automated parent-container docking.|
|`OnContextMenuRequested`|190|Parameter-based context menu event.|
|`ExecuteScriptOnPage`|191|Immediate, non-persistent script execution.|
|`ClearCache`|193|Clears Disk Cache & Local Storage.|

## 🧬 Understanding the GOG Demo Showcase (v1.4.2)

The **`examples\GOG_Demo_v1.4.2\gogDemo.au3`** is more than just a browser—it is a showcase of **Hybrid Intelligence**. It demonstrates how AutoIt can seamlessly orchestrate a modern, complex e-commerce environment (GOG.com) by combining native Windows logic with the Edge WebView2 DOM.

#### 1. Context-Aware Menu (GOG Edition)

The demo intercepts the native browser menu and replaces it with a dynamic AutoIt menu. The library "senses" exactly what is under your cursor:

- **🎮 Game Tile Intelligence**:
    
    - **Action**: Right-click on a game’s thumbnail or title.
        
    - **What happens**: The script extracts the `Game ID` and `Price` directly from the DOM, offering options to open the game in a new tab or add it to a local AutoIt-managed Watchlist.
        
- **📄 Professional Reporting (PDF & Screenshots)**:
    
    - **Action**: Right-click anywhere on the page.
        
    - **What happens**:
        
        - **Smart PDF Export**: Generates a clean **A4 PDF** report. Before exporting, it uses the new `InjectCss` method to dynamically strip away GOG’s headers, sidebars, and campaign banners for a professional, content-focused document.
            
        - **Full Page Capture**: Leverages the **Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)** to capture a high-resolution image of the entire page—even if it exceeds 6,000+ pixels in height—without scrolling artifacts.
            

#### 2. Advanced Framework Features

- **⚡ Native CSS Injection (`InjectCss`)**: Move beyond manual JavaScript DOM manipulation. The demo shows how a single line of AutoIt code can override a website’s layout, making it "Print-Friendly" instantly.
    
- **🔄 Synchronous Data Binding (`SyncInternalData`)**: Effortlessly synchronize complex JSON datasets from AutoIt directly into the browser’s memory. This allows your script to "inject" custom variables that the website’s JavaScript can read in real-time.
    
- **🛠 Robust Event Handling**: The demo implements a **Global COM Error Handler**. Even if the website encounters JavaScript errors or network lag, the AutoIt host remains stable and responsive.
    
- **📏 Precision Resizing**: Utilizing native OS message interception, the browser view adapts to GUI changes with pixel-perfect accuracy, eliminating the flickering typical of standard docking.

#### ⚙️ How it Works: The v1.4.2 "Direct Path"

Version 1.4.2 simplifies the communication bridge. While previous versions required complex event-callback chains, we now use the **Direct Path**:

1. **Unified Events**: The `OnContextMenuRequested` event now passes 4 clean parameters (Link, X, Y, Selected Text) directly. No more manual JSON parsing for standard context actions.
    
2. **Instant Execution**: With `ExecuteScriptWithResult`, AutoIt asks JavaScript a question (e.g., "What is the total price in the cart?") and receives the answer **immediately** in the next line of code, just like a native function.
    
3. **Persistent DNA**: Via `AddInitializationScript`, your custom bridge logic (like PDF cleaning or menu triggers) survives page reloads and site-wide navigation.
    

---

#### 💡 Pro Tip for Developers:

> "Version 1.4.2 is **GOG-Proof**. Use the `InjectCss` method during PDF Export to target dynamic elements like `.campaign-bar` or `nav`. Using wildcard selectors like `[class*='notification']` allows you to suppress annoying popups and banners automatically, turning any webpage into a clean business report."
